# React Portfolio

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Getting Started



## Projects

For each project you feature in your portfolio, you should include the following:

An image of the deployed application (either a GIF or a screenshot)

The title of the project

A link to the deployed application

A link to the corresponding GitHub repository

## Design

As with the previous portfolio Challenge, remember that "good" design is subjective; however, your site should look polished. Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

Use mobile-first design.

Choose a color palette so that your site doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. Look into resources like Coolors. Links to an external site. or another color scheme generator to help you create something that will stand out.

Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it may impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.

# React Portfolio

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter) 


## Getting Started

NOTE

The contact form should be similar to the one you built in the module project. Because this application doesn’t include a back end or connect to an API, you can set up this functionality the same way you did in the module project and add in back-end functionality after you’ve covered it in the next few modules.

In the meantime, consider adding your email address and phone number on the Contact page.

## Projects

For each project you feature in your portfolio, you should include the following:

An image of the deployed application (either a GIF or a screenshot)

The title of the project

A link to the deployed application

A link to the corresponding GitHub repository

## Design

As with the previous portfolio Challenge, remember that "good" design is subjective; however, your site should look polished. Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

Use mobile-first design.

Choose a color palette so that your site doesn't just look like the default Bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site. Look into resources like Coolors. Links to an external site. or another color scheme generator to help you create something that will stand out.

Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it may impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.
